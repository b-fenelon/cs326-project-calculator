## Application Idea
Often athletes are prescriped a strength program that chooses either kilogram or pound denominations of weight. However, it's usually the case that gym goers gravitate to whichever unit you are programmed in and the only available weight is in a unit different from the program. While a calculator and memorizing 2.205 solves this problem, it can be cumbersome to crunch numbers in the middle of a training session. Thus, I am creating an application that can be used either by an individual or a gym to post workouts using the weight plates available.
