# Milestone 2: User Interface

## Part I: Data Interactions
Users will have the ability to:
*  Increment the number of each weight designation (standard schemes: 2.5, 5, 10, 25, 35, 45lbs AND 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25kg) available at the gym
* Click a Create button to create a new exercise card/box
* Type in text box to name exercise
* Add repetitions to an exercise card by the add set button 
* Type in text box to write desired weight and closest possible weight will be displayed with one side of a barbell shown to instruct loading
* Between each set an HTML element will indicate the difference between sets (e.g. 100kg loaded for one set will tell the user to remove 5kg from each side to load 90kg)
* If possible, a start button can indicate the start time of an exercise and will trigger a timer to show users how long certain weights have been in use
