## Application Idea
Often athletes are prescriped a strength program that chooses either kilogram or pound denominations of weight. However, it's usually the case that gym goers gravitate to whichever unit you are programmed in and the only available weight is in a unit different from the program. While a calculator and memorizing 2.205 solves this problem, it can be cumbersome to crunch numbers in the middle of a training session. Thus, I am creating an application that can be used either by an individual or a gym to post workouts using the weight plates available.

This could be expanded as a general resource allocation visualizer (e.g. classroom with students).

## Functionality
To avoid simply creating a GUI of a barbell with plates of a selected unit, I am proposing a project that creates boxes with a titled exercise and weight used during each set. Based on the desired unit and input unit, a visual of the closest converted weight will be shown as a loaded barbell. A master/gym card will be required before any exercises are added because here a user will specify the weights available (e.g. 8 x 45lb plates, 2 x 2.5lbs plates, etc.), which determines how accurate the user can follow their program. 

Besides the visuals, users will have text suggestions on how to procede from set to set. For example, if a user has 135 lbs loaded and needs 145 lbs next, the application will write 'add 5 lbs to each side before your next set'. Each exercise card can be logged for start time with an expiration (e.g. 45 mins), to free up available weights for other users (shown as exercises) such that the application shows available weights in an entire gym at a given time.
